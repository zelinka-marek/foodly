# Food tracker

This is the final project for the course [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online/). The project is a food tracker app that allows users to track their meals and calories.The app is built in a series of steps, each step building on the previous step. No frameworks used, just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Here's a list of some of the topics that I applyied in this project:

- Data structures (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, arrays of objects) and their associated methods
- if conditions
- Iterations and Reduce
- Optional chaining & nullish coalescing
- Classes
- Fetch API (using the FetchWrapper)
- Modules & importing packages
- DOM API (selection, events, etc.)
- Closures
