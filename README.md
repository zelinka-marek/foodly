This project is the final challenge for the course [Learn JavaScript](https://learnjavascript.online/).

The project is a food tracker app that allows users to track their meals and calories. This application, is built in a series of steps, each step building on the previous step. I've used no frameworks, just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. I've used Vite for bundling and TailwindCSS for styling.

Here's a list of some of the topics that I applied in this project:

- Data structures (numbers, strings, arrays, objects, arrays of objects) and their associated methods
- if conditions
- Iterations and Reduce
- Optional chaining & nullish coalescing
- Classes
- Fetch API (using the FetchWrapper)
- Modules & importing packages
- DOM API (selection, events, etc.)
- Closures
